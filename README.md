# FitindicesAndResiduals
Incompatible Issue b/w chi-square fit indices and residual matrix in SEM

Details are in Browne, M. W., MacCallum, R. C., Kim, C. T., Andersen, B. L., & Glaser, R. (2002). When fit indices and residuals are incompatible. Psychological methods, 7(4), 403.

Good fit indices and bad residual issue is another one.

Aim of this project:
1. Correlation Matrix finding algorithm that results in target RESIDUAL matrix when fitted to implied Factor Analysis Model
2. Extend the issue comprehension to general SEM problem
3. Encompass the [Good fit indices/Bad residual] issue so that suggest a general framework.
